The first exploit that I found was was being able to boot another operating system using the computers hardware. Therefor, in theory a person could boot these computers, install what ever operating they wanted, and then sell the computers online. To test this I used linux (Ubuntu and Lubuntu) sense they are open source and have very small .iso's (three gigibytes at the most.) If a computer was not bitlocker enabled, a person could use diffrent exploits that I could address to gain Administrator access on the core operating system. In this case I was using a Kingston data travler 3.0 with 14.3 gigs of space and usb 3.0. It ran the whole operating system really well.
